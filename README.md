## About The Project

![Product Name Screen Shot](/public/images/readme/Sacada_Main_Page.png)

Sacada do Prédio is a web application where people can post their needs so that people from their community can help. The idea for the name comes from the multiple examples of people gathering in their balconies (Sacada in portuguese) to hang out, play music and stick together in the midst of the social distancing caused by the coronavirus pandemic.

Our balcony provides us with a place where we can hang out and connect with people, but it also provides us with a view of our neighbourhood and community, why not use it to help others who are in need?

Our goal is to provide a platform where users can register and post new cases. Whenever a new case is posted, all users within that area are notified so that they can possibly help.
